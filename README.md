# single_page_app_template
This is a starting point for website building using Angular.js

##Demo

http://jeremykasala.com/spa

##Usage

- Clone the repo: 

```sh 
https://github.com/jkasala/single_page_app_template.git
```

- Even though there are only javascript and HTML files here, they must still be served on a web server because otherwise Angular will give you an error.  Any server will do, and once the files are on there you can open index.html with your browser.
