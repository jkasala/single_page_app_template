# single_page_app_template
This is a starting point for website building using Angular.js

##Demo

http://jeremykasala.com/spa

##Usage

- Clone the repo: 

```sh 
https://github.com/jkasala/single_page_app_template.git
```

- There are only HTML and Javascript files here but you need an HTTP server to host them - Angular will give you an error if you try to open index.html in your browser otherwise.
