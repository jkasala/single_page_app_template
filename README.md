# single_page_app_template
This template is meant to serve as a starting point for website building.  It is a single page app, so the page loads only once and content is loaded in via AJAX.  It uses Bootstrap so it's 100% responsive.

##Demo

##Usage

- Clone the repo: 

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/jkasala/testimonials.git 
```

- Even though there are only javascript and HTML files involved, they must still be served on a web server because otherwise Angular will give you an error.  Once place on your server, you can open index.html with your browser.
